  <p>Let me introduce you to my support for going through school, my family! They've all had my back, comforted me, and are the reason why I'm working so hard with 2 jobs and going through school. Let's get to know each one of them!!</p>

    <p>Meet Melanie. We met about 4 years ago and have been engaged going on 2 years. She's a caring and loving mother and one of my biggest supporters! She herself got accepted into one of the top nursing schools in the state and I'm super proud of her! She's had my back from the start when I started talking about going to school. She would mention it here and there, and then finally now I'm working on it. She get's really excited (whether it's in support or curiosity) when I show her what I'm learning and the projects I've been doing. She keeps telling me how proud she is of me and it makes me really happy that she's in my corner. She's the love of my life and I couldn't have asked for a better partner!</p>

    <p>This is Robbie. He's 5, going on 6, and is excited for just about anything. When he talks to me or about me, Melanie tells me he has a big smile and just gets super happy at times. Here lately, he's been wanting daddy (aka Me) to teach him how to hunt. A year and a half ago, we started getting him into fishing, and now that he's got his own toy Nerf bow and arrow set, he wants to be just like me and hunt lol. And of course, we've included his mother into this, so now we're going to be a hunting family due to this kid, which Melanie and I love. He's one of the best things that's happened to me and I love him with all my heart. He's my first kid, my first boy, and will always be in my heart!</p>

    <p>Last but not least, meet Pip. He's a German Shephard and Mountain Curr mix that at 11 months old has reached 70 pounds!! He's still learning what to and not to do, so it can be a challenge at times. He's the newest addition to the family and we all care for him. The kiddo absolutely loves Pip, but what 5 year old doesn't love a cuddly dog? Pip loves attention and will always be up for some snuggles when you lay down. He's going to be a great dog, just needs some more training lol.</p>
  <h2>Wrapping It Up!</h2>
    <p>I want to thank you for taking time to take a look at my first website and meeting my family! I hope you come back for more as I continue to add what I learn! I'm getting excited to see what potential this site has from what I learn from school, and that just tells me that I'm going to school for the right thing! Thank you, again, for stopping by and please come back later on to see what's new!</p>
